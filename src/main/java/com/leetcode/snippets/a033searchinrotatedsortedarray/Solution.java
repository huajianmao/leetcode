 * Desc:
 * =====
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 *
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
