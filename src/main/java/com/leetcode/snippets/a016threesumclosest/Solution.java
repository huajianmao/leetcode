 * Desc:
 * =====
 * Given an array S of n integers,
 * find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
 * Return the sum of the three integers.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
