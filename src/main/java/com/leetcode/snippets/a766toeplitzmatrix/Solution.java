 * A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.
 *
 * Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * matrix = [
 *   [1,2,3,4],
 *   [5,1,2,3],
 *   [9,5,1,2]
 * ]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * In the above grid, the diagonals are:
 * "[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
 * In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * matrix = [
 *   [1,2],
 *   [2,2]
 * ]
 * Output: False
 * Explanation:
 * The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
 *
 * Note:
 * matrix will be a 2D array of integers.
 * matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
 * matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].?
