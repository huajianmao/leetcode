 * We define a harmonious array is an array
 * where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
 *
 * Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence
 * among all its possible subsequences.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 *
 * Note: The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.
